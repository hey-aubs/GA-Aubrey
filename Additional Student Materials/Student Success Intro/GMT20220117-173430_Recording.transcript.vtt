00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:26.790
Steph Laraway: I was as a reminder attendance has taken at every class meaning at the start of class just you guys know three late arrivals or early departures will constitute as one absence so keep track of those.

15
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:38.610
Steph Laraway: Just to reiterate, most of you are here because you want to find a job as a web developer after this course, some of you have different ambitions, regardless of what you're looking to do.

16
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:49.650
Steph Laraway: I want you guys to remind yourselves that you'll only be successful in this class if everyone here decides ahead of time to treat this next time weeks as your job.

17
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.630
Steph Laraway: So much everybody will take place in the classroom whether that's instructors introducing material group lab collaboration.

18
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.200
Steph Laraway: just want to emphasize that being here every day is critical and as a reminder you can't miss one in three days of class.

19
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:17.490

20
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:31.710

21
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.780
Steph Laraway: Normally it's a code challenge or mini project sometimes it's a study assignment mostly.

22
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:48.360
Steph Laraway: instructors will need those to be completed for the next day, and they expect that students put in these two hours each evening to get these assignments done.

23
00:03:49.290 --> 00:04:06.060
Steph Laraway: projects will be every three weeks instructors will take focus time to build with you guys have projects hackathon style during project week you guys will have stayed up check ins to assess your progress, those are mandatory to attend so keep that in mind.

24

Steph Laraway: you'll need to complete these projects, received a passing grade and those rubrics will be sent out by your instructor about what constitutes a pass versus not passing just as a reminder.

25
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:32.250
