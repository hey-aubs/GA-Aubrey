*** About Mood Music ***
The goal of Mood Music is to provide users with a Spotify playlist that matches their current mood. The user selects a mood from the drop-down menu provided. Once a selection is made, a relevant playlist populates for the users to listen to and enjoy.

*** Objectives ***
Demonstrate an understanding of all topics covered during this course:
- HTML provides the page structure
- CSS defines the page styling and responsiveness for screens of different widths
- JavaScript makes the drop-down menu interactive and hides the playlist recommendation section when no mood is selected
